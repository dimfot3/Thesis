# Thesis
## Overview
The repository contains the code for my academic thesis [[1]](#1) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The thesis' major goal was to examine at digital indoor reconstruction and human detection algorithms using LiDAR technology. The project includes two subprojects that can be used in together or separately. The first is thesis simulation [[2]](#2), which includes indoor simulation monitoring with simulated LiDAR. The second is thesis detection systems [[3]](#3), which includes plane and human detection systems.
