# Thesis
## Overview
The repository is code of my academic thesis [1] at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The main objective of the thesis was to investigate digital indoor reconstruction and human detection algorithms using LiDAR technology. The project contain two subprojects that can be exploited together or seperately. The first is thesis simulation that contain implementation of indoor simulation monitoring by simulated LiDAR. The second is thesis detection system that contain plane and human detection systems.
